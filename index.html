          <p>
            While a technologist at heart, I enjoy working at the intersection of  
            business and technology, looking to find innovative ways to drive business
            growth in this increasingly digital age.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a software engineer at Amazon, I gained significant experience in a short
            period of time by leading several projects, such as designing
            and creating product roadmaps for a microservice architecture that would 
            integrate AI/ML workflows and developing the data ingestion framework for 
            Halo Rise, a first of its kind bedside sleep tracker. 
            To build my business skillset, I completed my MBA from the Kellogg School of Management in June 2024.

                  I love reading about new technologies and how they work, ranging from 
                  the VR and Bitcoin/Blockchain crazes nearly a decade ago to more recently,
                  generative AI. I enjoy looking into practical applications of such technologies

                  AI-related topics since 2015 when I was in high school. I have worked
                  with AI in many different forms such as robotics, computer vision,
                  NLP, machine learning (random forests, neural networks), and, 
                  of course, generative AI.

              <span>June 2023 — August 2023</span>
              <p class="timeline-text">
                For my MBA summer internship, I interned with a pre-seed startup 
                building a community platform to share stories from senior tech executives 
                in the startup world through podcast and newsletter content. While my prior
                experience had been at a big tech company in Amazon, I was excited to 
                develop my business strategy and product skills in a brand new startup
                environment.
                <br/> <br/>
                During the internship, I identified an opportunity to leverage generative AI
                to automate significant portions of content creation, which typically 
                takes creators hours of time. While some AI podcast tools existed in 
                the market, all offered relatively standardized outputs, ignoring the personal 
                tone behind authoring original pieces that drives organic podcast growth.
                <br/> <br/>
                Therefore, I owned end-to-end creation of a minimum viable product of a generative
                AI driven podcast tool that could offer more customization towards the author's purpose and audience,
                and be trained upon prior content created by the user. During the internship, I 
                performed customer interviews, market segmentation analysis, product requirements document,
                and concept testing. 
                <br/> <br/>
                At the end of the internship, I had developed a prioritized feature backlog and
                wireframes for components that could not be implemented during the internship.

                In this role, I developed components for sleep data ingestion

                designing and coordinating load testing to support over 400 TPS,

                I started my full-time professional career in Amazon Denied Party Screening. 
                When I joined, the organization was brand new, allowing me to grow rapidly
                and take on larger responsibilities quicker, including my promotion to SDE2
                in under 1.5 years.
                <br/> <br/>
                As part of the organization, I spent time designing a microservice 
                architecture built on AWS, including a transition to a real-time machine
                learning processing system and developing several products' roadmaps for 
                our alert processing system and case management platform. These systems 
                helped reduce manual investigation effort by 90% while increasing 
                system throughput. 
                <br/> <br/>
                As a tech lead, I also mentored several teammates and interns during the 
                rapid expansion of the engineering team, including leading a brand new 
                team created in India by helping them get up to speed to deliver a 
                data aggregation tool that simplified user experience.

                recruitment through redeployment that reduced data entry and processing 
                time by 67%. In addition, I produced data analytics tools that could
                demonstrate project growth and would be used to display data in future

              <a href="#" class="project-link" data-title="Global Initiatives in Management China" data-description="In the Winter 2024 quarter, 
              I participated in Kellogg's Global Initiatives in Management (GIM) class about China in the Global Economy. 
              As part of the class, my team researched how Chinese families build wealth 
              using real estate, a topic that is especially relevant given the recent market 
              trends in China. That March, we spent 2 weeks of our spring break traveling to Shanghai, Guilin, and Hong Kong.
              I had a great time getting to know students across Kellogg's MBA programs and 
              meeting business leaders who provided us with great insight into China's role 
              in the global economy and our team's research topic. As one of first few American
              student groups to go to China in the last 5 years, the trip felt especially 
              meaningful. While we often are exposed to the differences between US and China, 
              it was refreshing to see firsthand the many similarities that do exist between 
              the countries.">

              helps to better prepare students for careers in tech. Each of the workshops reached
              capacity, and the club workshop on APIs had over 100 signups! Here is a link to the
